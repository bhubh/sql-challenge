##ERD TABLE and Schema

In this work,  Entity Relational Diagram (ERD) were created based on the different data files in 'data' folder. The data includes information about employee, department, and salaries for a company. The data-type and primary key as well as foreign keys were also defined for each table. The ERD data generator code was exported into SQL Postgress to generate tables for each data file. The data files were imported into the tables in postgress-schemas.
